      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
          Hoshimy Animation is a company passionate about creativity and visual storytelling. We were born with the mission of bringing anime, manga, and Asian culture to Latin America in a fair and accessible way. Our purpose is to open doors for artists and creators who dream of sharing their talent but often face high costs, lack of resources, or limited visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
          We specialize in the creation of manga, light novels, and music, promoting Japanese culture while providing opportunities to artists with limited resources. We believe that every story deserves to be told and that every creator should have the chance to see their work recognized.
      </p>
      <p>
          We know that many dream of turning their projects into anime, and although that path may seem distant, we work to make it possible. We offer a comprehensive service that covers everything from conceptualization to publication, ensuring that each creation is recognized as its own. We also provide advice, workshops, and training to hone skills, and when a work gains popularity, we offer the opportunity to bring it to animation.
      </p>
      <p>
          Additionally, we offer a professional translation service for Asian content into English and Spanish. We adapt literary works, visual material, and even anime-themed video games, always ensuring that the original essence remains intact to connect with new audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
          At Hoshimy Animation, we believe in the power of stories and the strength of the creative community. We are a bridge between Latin America and Asia, a space where artists, fans, and dreamers can grow, learn, and share their passion.
